00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.425
See you tomorrow.

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:49.778
Oh, my God!

00:02:12.426 --> 00:02:13.928
I'm in.

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:08.834
We're almost there.

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:12.963
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.049
I understand, sir. It's just that...

00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:18.594
...I'm scoping some serious
sentinel activity up here.

00:04:56.757 --> 00:04:59.176
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

00:04:59.343 --> 00:05:02.471
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

00:05:02.638 --> 00:05:05.307
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

00:05:05.474 --> 00:05:09.478
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.480
What's that, sir?

00:05:12.231 --> 00:05:13.524
To trust me.

00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:15.651
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

00:05:17.695 --> 00:05:20.865
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:24.410
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

00:05:24.577 --> 00:05:25.661
Yes, sir.

00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:36.755
Still can't sleep?

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:40.092
You wanna talk?

00:05:42.428 --> 00:05:44.805
They're just dreams.

00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:49.518
If you're afraid of something...

00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:51.520
I just wish...

00:05:52.188 --> 00:05:54.440
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

00:05:54.607 --> 00:05:56.442
That's all.

00:05:57.359 --> 00:05:58.944
I just wish I knew.

00:05:59.111 --> 00:06:03.365
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

00:06:03.532 --> 00:06:04.575
Here you are.

00:06:04.742 --> 00:06:08.204
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.000
<i>These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.</i>

00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:15.419
The machines are digging.

00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:19.381
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.

00:06:19.548 --> 00:06:22.134
- Mother...
- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:23.802
How fast are they moving?

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.348
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

00:06:27.515 --> 00:06:29.975
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

00:06:30.142 --> 00:06:33.687
<i>- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can't be accurate.</i>

00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:35.773
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.400
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

00:06:38.567 --> 00:06:40.069
- That's right.
- That can't be.

00:06:40.236 --> 00:06:41.904
Why not?

00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:45.824
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

00:06:46.784 --> 00:06:50.746
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

00:06:50.913 --> 00:06:53.082
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

00:06:53.582 --> 00:06:54.750
Niobe.

00:06:56.126 --> 00:06:59.505
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:03.467
...it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

00:07:03.634 --> 00:07:06.387
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Lines are crawling with them.

00:07:06.554 --> 00:07:10.349
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

00:07:10.516 --> 00:07:11.642
What are we gonna do?

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:14.103
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.

00:07:14.436 --> 00:07:17.022
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:22.319
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

00:07:22.486 --> 00:07:25.155
A strategy is still being formulated.

00:07:25.322 --> 00:07:26.991
I'm sure it is.

00:07:42.006 --> 00:07:44.008
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

00:07:44.216 --> 00:07:46.343
- We should proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.553
I don't know.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.514
...however, I must ask one of you
for help.

00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:56.395
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...

00:07:56.562 --> 00:07:59.106
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

00:07:59.273 --> 00:08:03.527
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

00:08:03.694 --> 00:08:07.031
...the Oracle must be consulted.

00:08:14.955 --> 00:08:17.208
If we return and recharge now...

00:08:17.374 --> 00:08:21.128
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

00:08:21.337 --> 00:08:23.172
Do you understand what you're asking?

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:26.175
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

00:08:26.342 --> 00:08:29.053
...in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.348
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

00:08:32.515 --> 00:08:37.061
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

00:08:37.228 --> 00:08:39.855
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

00:08:40.022 --> 00:08:41.941
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

00:08:42.107 --> 00:08:44.527
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

00:08:44.693 --> 00:08:45.903
He won't.

00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:50.241
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.702
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

00:08:53.869 --> 00:08:55.412
You got 36 hours.

00:08:58.207 --> 00:09:00.042
I'm looking for Neo.

00:09:00.209 --> 00:09:03.587
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

00:09:04.797 --> 00:09:07.007
A gift.

00:09:07.216 --> 00:09:10.094
You see, he set me free.

00:09:12.388 --> 00:09:14.765
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

00:09:15.307 --> 00:09:18.352
- Who was that?
- How did you know someone was here?

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.979
He gave you this.

00:09:25.734 --> 00:09:27.152
He said you set him free.

00:09:29.113 --> 00:09:31.448
Is everything all right, sir?

00:09:32.074 --> 00:09:34.451
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

00:09:34.618 --> 00:09:36.829
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

00:09:37.288 --> 00:09:38.664
Go.

00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:49.550
Hiya, fellas.

00:09:49.717 --> 00:09:50.843
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.261
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:54.930
- He is still...
- Only human.

00:10:01.812 --> 00:10:03.355
Upgrades.

00:10:58.285 --> 00:11:00.830
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

00:11:00.996 --> 00:11:03.666
It's happening exactly as before.

00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:06.502
Well, not exactly.

00:11:10.214 --> 00:11:12.341
- What happened?
- I can't figure it out.

00:11:12.508 --> 00:11:14.176
Agents just came out of nowhere.

00:11:14.343 --> 00:11:17.346
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

00:11:17.513 --> 00:11:20.432
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

00:11:20.599 --> 00:11:22.017
Where is he now?

00:11:23.477 --> 00:11:25.229
He's doing his Superman thing.

00:12:15.196 --> 00:12:16.655
Where are you?

00:12:21.327 --> 00:12:24.914
<i>This is the Nebuchadnezzar,
requesting access through Gate Three.</i>

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:33.422
<i>Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.</i>

00:12:33.589 --> 00:12:35.090
<i>Roger that, Control,</i>

00:12:35.257 --> 00:12:38.761
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

00:12:39.553 --> 00:12:42.765
<i>We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.</i>

00:12:48.354 --> 00:12:51.273
<i>You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven,</i>

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.150
Roger that, Control.

00:13:00.282 --> 00:13:03.369
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:06.288
No place like it.

00:13:20.469 --> 00:13:24.181
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

00:14:13.689 --> 00:14:16.108
<i>The Nebuchadnezzar is down,
Bay Seven,</i>

00:14:16.275 --> 00:14:17.443
Understood.

00:14:27.411 --> 00:14:28.704
Captain Mifune.

00:14:29.788 --> 00:14:30.956
Captain Morpheus.

00:14:31.123 --> 00:14:33.959
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:37.546
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands...

00:14:38.797 --> 00:14:41.967
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

00:14:42.885 --> 00:14:44.720
- Link.
- Sir?

00:14:44.887 --> 00:14:47.473
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.183
Understood, sir.

00:14:56.357 --> 00:14:58.776
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

00:14:59.902 --> 00:15:02.071
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

00:15:02.238 --> 00:15:05.449
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.285
What happened?

00:15:08.494 --> 00:15:11.914
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:14.750
Yeah, she can do that.

00:15:14.917 --> 00:15:16.085
Neo!

00:15:17.086 --> 00:15:19.964
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.091
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

00:15:22.258 --> 00:15:24.969
You know what they say
about the life you save.

00:15:25.135 --> 00:15:26.929
I didn't save his life.

00:15:29.098 --> 00:15:30.474
Hiya, Neo.

00:15:31.642 --> 00:15:34.270
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

00:15:34.436 --> 00:15:38.107
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

00:15:38.274 --> 00:15:41.026
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

00:15:41.193 --> 00:15:42.862
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:46.699
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.125
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

00:15:56.292 --> 00:15:59.044
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.

00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:00.671
Let me guess.

00:16:01.172 --> 00:16:03.132
<i>I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

00:16:04.133 --> 00:16:07.678
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.

00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:09.221
I'm sure he has reasons...

00:16:09.388 --> 00:16:12.725
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

00:16:12.892 --> 00:16:14.435
You know, it's fate.

00:16:14.602 --> 00:16:16.145
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

00:16:16.312 --> 00:16:18.856
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.

00:16:19.023 --> 00:16:21.567
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

00:16:22.693 --> 00:16:24.320
You saved yourself.

00:16:40.628 --> 00:16:43.923
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

00:16:44.173 --> 00:16:45.674
I spoke to the other captains.

00:16:45.841 --> 00:16:48.677
I wanted to offer you a chance
to explain your actions.

00:16:48.844 --> 00:16:51.514
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.057
You were given an order...

00:16:53.224 --> 00:16:55.267
...to return to Zion.
- I did.

00:16:55.434 --> 00:16:57.186
You asked for one ship
to remain behind.

00:16:57.353 --> 00:17:00.022
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:02.900
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

00:17:03.067 --> 00:17:06.487
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

00:17:06.654 --> 00:17:08.614
I don't want to hear that shit!

00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:11.450
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

00:17:11.617 --> 00:17:15.037
I care about one thing: Stopping
that army from destroying this city.

00:17:15.204 --> 00:17:18.040
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

00:17:18.207 --> 00:17:22.795
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

00:17:22.962 --> 00:17:24.380
How?

00:17:24.547 --> 00:17:27.341
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

00:17:27.508 --> 00:17:30.135
Not everyone believes what you believe.

00:17:30.302 --> 00:17:32.388
My beliefs do not require them to.

00:17:40.563 --> 00:17:44.483
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.403
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.531
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

00:17:50.698 --> 00:17:53.868
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:02.293
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

00:18:15.306 --> 00:18:18.267
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

00:18:18.434 --> 00:18:20.769
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

00:18:20.936 --> 00:18:24.815
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set
foot on a ship for the rest of your life.

00:18:24.982 --> 00:18:28.277
Then I am grateful
that it is not up to you.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.619
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

00:18:37.286 --> 00:18:39.997
- Captain.
- Councillor.

00:18:40.164 --> 00:18:43.542
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:45.085
The presence of the fleet...

00:18:45.252 --> 00:18:47.796
...and the persistence of rumors
must be addressed.

00:18:47.963 --> 00:18:50.466
The people must be told
what is happening.

00:18:50.633 --> 00:18:52.343
Of course, councillor.

00:18:53.052 --> 00:18:58.307
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

00:18:58.474 --> 00:19:01.477
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

00:19:01.644 --> 00:19:04.730
A panic is not what anyone wants.

00:19:04.897 --> 00:19:08.234
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

00:19:10.653 --> 00:19:15.407
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

00:19:15.574 --> 00:19:17.701
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

00:19:18.494 --> 00:19:22.081
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

00:19:22.248 --> 00:19:24.124
Consider that in the past six months...

00:19:24.291 --> 00:19:26.335
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

00:19:26.502 --> 00:19:29.505
This attack is an act of desperation.

00:19:29.672 --> 00:19:33.509
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

00:19:35.386 --> 00:19:37.513
I hope you're right, captain.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.391
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

00:19:40.558 --> 00:19:43.143
It is simply a matter of time.

00:19:45.312 --> 00:19:46.772
My stop.

00:19:46.939 --> 00:19:48.357
See you soon.

00:19:48.524 --> 00:19:49.984
Hopefully not too soon.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.320
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

00:20:02.746 --> 00:20:04.498
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

00:20:04.665 --> 00:20:07.084
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

00:20:07.251 --> 00:20:10.588
<i>- How long do we charge the Neb?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.</i>

00:20:10.754 --> 00:20:14.967
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

00:20:39.408 --> 00:20:43.746
<i>Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.</i>

00:20:43.913 --> 00:20:47.416
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

00:20:47.583 --> 00:20:49.668
<i>I have a daughter on the Icarus.</i>

00:20:50.461 --> 00:20:51.754
No, wait.

00:20:51.921 --> 00:20:54.423
It's all right. They need you.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.842
- I need you.
- I know.

00:20:57.384 --> 00:20:59.678
There's time.

00:21:04.642 --> 00:21:06.769
Where's my puss...?

00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:09.271
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

00:21:09.438 --> 00:21:11.065
God!

00:21:11.232 --> 00:21:13.192
Uncle Link!

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:16.946
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

00:21:17.112 --> 00:21:19.281
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

00:21:19.448 --> 00:21:20.991
- Yeah!
- Okay!

00:21:21.158 --> 00:21:22.868
Okay? All right.

00:21:23.035 --> 00:21:26.080
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

00:21:26.247 --> 00:21:28.457
One, two, three, lift!

00:21:28.624 --> 00:21:31.794
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:34.672
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

00:21:36.465 --> 00:21:37.800
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

00:21:38.342 --> 00:21:40.886
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

00:21:41.053 --> 00:21:42.888
You be careful with her.

00:21:43.055 --> 00:21:45.850
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

00:21:47.685 --> 00:21:50.062
Out the door! Both of you, march!

00:21:50.229 --> 00:21:52.273
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:21:58.654 --> 00:22:00.197
I'm gonna get what?

00:22:01.365 --> 00:22:03.200
Every ship up there's
been home two...

00:22:03.367 --> 00:22:05.703
<i>...even three times more
than the Nebuchadnezzar,</i>

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.582
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

00:22:09.748 --> 00:22:13.169
- We'll be when you operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

00:22:13.335 --> 00:22:14.837
- Why?
- You know why.

00:22:15.004 --> 00:22:18.174
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

00:22:18.883 --> 00:22:21.427
Maybe. But it's too late now.

00:22:21.594 --> 00:22:24.221
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

00:22:24.388 --> 00:22:27.099
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

00:22:27.266 --> 00:22:30.227
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.361
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

00:22:40.446 --> 00:22:42.656
I'm afraid of it.

00:22:44.241 --> 00:22:46.869
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

00:22:47.536 --> 00:22:49.371
It won't.

00:22:49.538 --> 00:22:51.373
How can you say that to me?

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.501
Because of Morpheus.

00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:58.297
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

00:22:58.464 --> 00:23:02.676
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

00:23:03.177 --> 00:23:06.388
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

00:23:06.555 --> 00:23:10.017
...after being on that ship and seeing
Neo do the things he can do...

00:23:10.184 --> 00:23:11.894
...I gotta say...

00:23:12.061 --> 00:23:14.104
...I'm starting to believe him too.

00:23:19.235 --> 00:23:21.654
Be careful, Link.

00:23:26.992 --> 00:23:29.370
Please be careful.

00:23:38.337 --> 00:23:39.505
They started yet?

00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:41.882
Only Councillor Hamann's
opening prayer.

00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:45.135
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

00:23:45.302 --> 00:23:47.930
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

00:23:48.097 --> 00:23:52.351
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

00:23:52.518 --> 00:23:54.186
...our children.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.898
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

00:23:58.065 --> 00:24:01.277
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

00:24:01.443 --> 00:24:04.738
...and who stand here beside us.

00:24:04.947 --> 00:24:08.617
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

00:24:08.784 --> 00:24:11.996
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

00:24:12.163 --> 00:24:17.543
...but who I believe has something
to say that we all need to hear.

00:24:18.544 --> 00:24:20.129
I give you Morpheus.

00:24:39.648 --> 00:24:43.819
Zion! Hear me!

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.948
It is true what many of you have heard.

00:24:48.115 --> 00:24:52.119
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

00:24:52.286 --> 00:24:56.207
...that army is drawing nearer
to our home.

00:24:57.666 --> 00:25:02.338
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:09.178
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

00:25:09.678 --> 00:25:14.600
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

00:25:15.184 --> 00:25:16.936
Why?

00:25:17.353 --> 00:25:20.189
Because I believe something you do not?

00:25:20.356 --> 00:25:22.191
No!

00:25:22.483 --> 00:25:27.446
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

00:25:27.613 --> 00:25:31.534
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.037
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

00:25:35.204 --> 00:25:39.875
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

00:25:40.042 --> 00:25:44.797
I remember that for 100 years they
have sent their armies to destroy us.

00:25:44.964 --> 00:25:51.053
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

00:25:51.929 --> 00:25:54.932
We are still here!

00:26:01.647 --> 00:26:03.732
Tonight...

00:26:03.899 --> 00:26:07.278
...let us send a message to that army.

00:26:07.444 --> 00:26:10.489
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

00:26:10.656 --> 00:26:14.535
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

00:26:14.702 --> 00:26:17.830
...of earth, steel and stone.

00:26:17.997 --> 00:26:23.252
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

00:26:23.419 --> 00:26:27.965
Tonight, let us make them remember:

00:26:28.132 --> 00:26:33.095
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

00:26:56.452 --> 00:26:58.454
I remember.

00:26:59.288 --> 00:27:01.707
I remember you used to dance.

00:27:03.334 --> 00:27:06.629
I remember you were pretty good.

00:27:07.379 --> 00:27:10.633
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

00:27:11.425 --> 00:27:14.220
...that will never change.

00:27:15.513 --> 00:27:17.431
Niobe!

00:27:22.144 --> 00:27:23.896
Some things do change.

00:27:43.165 --> 00:27:45.000
Excuse me.

00:27:56.846 --> 00:28:00.349
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

00:28:00.808 --> 00:28:04.520
I was thinking, everyone is here.

00:28:05.062 --> 00:28:07.356
Follow me.

00:31:28.349 --> 00:31:31.936
Neo, what is it?

00:31:32.228 --> 00:31:34.480
What's wrong?

00:31:36.065 --> 00:31:38.400
It's okay, you can tell me.

00:31:38.776 --> 00:31:41.278
Trinity...

00:31:41.445 --> 00:31:44.240
Don't be afraid.

00:31:44.406 --> 00:31:46.742
I can't lose you.

00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:48.786
You're not gonna lose me.

00:31:52.915 --> 00:31:55.793
You feel this?

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.753
I'm never letting go.

00:32:34.957 --> 00:32:37.626
Good night, Zion.

00:32:37.793 --> 00:32:40.462
Sweet dreams.

00:32:50.639 --> 00:32:52.308
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

00:32:52.474 --> 00:32:55.102
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:57.354
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.

00:32:57.521 --> 00:32:59.815
You first.

00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:13.579
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

00:33:25.508 --> 00:33:29.386
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

00:34:18.769 --> 00:34:22.064
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.776
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

00:34:26.235 --> 00:34:29.780
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:32.616
So could I.

00:34:35.744 --> 00:34:38.247
It's nice tonight.

00:34:38.747 --> 00:34:41.167
Very calm.

00:34:41.333 --> 00:34:44.086
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

00:34:44.461 --> 00:34:46.922
Not everyone.

00:34:47.214 --> 00:34:51.927
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

00:34:52.094 --> 00:34:56.140
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

00:34:56.599 --> 00:35:01.312
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

00:35:02.771 --> 00:35:05.941
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

00:35:06.108 --> 00:35:09.278
That you are in fact still human.

00:35:12.865 --> 00:35:16.785
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

00:35:16.952 --> 00:35:19.997
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

00:35:20.164 --> 00:35:22.708
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

00:35:33.385 --> 00:35:37.848
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

00:35:38.015 --> 00:35:43.103
That's how it is with people. Nobody
cares how it works as long as it works.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.564
I like it down here.

00:35:45.731 --> 00:35:51.529
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

00:35:51.695 --> 00:35:53.531
These machines are keeping us alive...

00:35:53.697 --> 00:35:56.826
...while other machines
are coming to kill us.

00:35:57.243 --> 00:36:02.081
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

00:36:02.248 --> 00:36:05.459
...and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

00:36:05.626 --> 00:36:08.337
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

00:36:08.504 --> 00:36:11.966
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

00:36:12.132 --> 00:36:15.135
And when I look at these machines...

00:36:15.302 --> 00:36:20.391
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

00:36:20.683 --> 00:36:23.561
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

00:36:23.978 --> 00:36:26.981
Of course not. How could they?

00:36:27.147 --> 00:36:29.692
The idea is pure nonsense...

00:36:30.192 --> 00:36:33.320
...but it does make one wonder just...

00:36:33.487 --> 00:36:35.072
...what is control?

00:36:35.322 --> 00:36:38.367
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

00:36:38.742 --> 00:36:43.205
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

00:36:43.831 --> 00:36:47.209
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

00:36:47.376 --> 00:36:49.461
Although if we did,
we'd have to consider...

00:36:49.628 --> 00:36:51.589
...what would happen to our lights...

00:36:51.755 --> 00:36:54.425
...our heat, our air.

00:36:55.426 --> 00:36:59.555
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

00:36:59.722 --> 00:37:02.349
No. No point.

00:37:03.058 --> 00:37:07.146
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

00:37:07.938 --> 00:37:11.734
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

00:37:11.901 --> 00:37:13.569
Good point.

00:37:14.278 --> 00:37:18.449
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

00:37:18.616 --> 00:37:21.869
There is so much in this world...

00:37:22.036 --> 00:37:24.955
...that I do not understand.

00:37:26.749 --> 00:37:31.504
See that machine? It has something
to do with recycling our water supply.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.673
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:38.928
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

00:37:40.429 --> 00:37:44.934
I have absolutely no idea how you are
able to do some of the things you do.

00:37:46.101 --> 00:37:49.271
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

00:37:50.147 --> 00:37:55.277
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

00:38:01.784 --> 00:38:03.452
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

00:38:05.871 --> 00:38:08.457
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

00:38:11.418 --> 00:38:13.128
It's time to go.

00:38:14.088 --> 00:38:16.549
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

00:38:16.715 --> 00:38:21.136
I don't know. Maybe
the prophecy's true, maybe it's not.

00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:24.849
All I know is,
that ship needs an operator.

00:38:26.433 --> 00:38:28.310
Right now, that operator's me.

00:38:28.936 --> 00:38:31.021
I know.

00:38:35.985 --> 00:38:37.653
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.906
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

00:38:41.198 --> 00:38:44.160
It's always brought me luck.

00:38:44.326 --> 00:38:48.455
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

00:38:48.622 --> 00:38:53.169
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

00:38:53.878 --> 00:38:57.506
Just keep it with you. Please.

00:38:57.673 --> 00:38:59.758
For me.

00:39:02.178 --> 00:39:04.471
Okay.

00:39:23.949 --> 00:39:26.118
- Neo!
- How the hell...?

00:39:26.535 --> 00:39:28.704
Bane.

00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:30.206
Is something wrong?

00:39:30.372 --> 00:39:32.082
No, I'm fine.

00:39:32.249 --> 00:39:35.044
I just wanted to catch you to say...

00:39:35.211 --> 00:39:37.046
...good luck.

00:39:38.714 --> 00:39:40.424
Thanks.

00:39:40.591 --> 00:39:43.010
We'll see you.

00:39:44.595 --> 00:39:47.681
Neo! Just in time.

00:39:47.848 --> 00:39:50.184
- You're gonna see the Oracle?
- There's no time.

00:39:50.351 --> 00:39:51.977
I had to give something to Neo.

00:39:52.686 --> 00:39:55.397
A gift from one of the orphans.

00:39:55.564 --> 00:39:58.984
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.321
He said you'd understand.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.117
Thanks.

00:40:14.208 --> 00:40:17.127
<i>I was just told you cleared
the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.</i>

00:40:17.294 --> 00:40:19.255
That is correct.

00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:21.382
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?

00:40:21.549 --> 00:40:22.842
Of course.

00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:27.596
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.349
I understand that, commander.

00:40:30.516 --> 00:40:33.102
<i>Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?</i>

00:40:33.269 --> 00:40:38.148
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

00:40:40.651 --> 00:40:42.945
Be careful.

00:41:11.974 --> 00:41:14.185
Hello.

00:41:24.487 --> 00:41:28.032
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

00:41:31.076 --> 00:41:35.581
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

00:41:35.831 --> 00:41:37.541
Apologize for what?

00:41:38.209 --> 00:41:40.002
For this.

00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:39.562
Good.

00:42:42.064 --> 00:42:45.234
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

00:42:45.401 --> 00:42:47.611
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.824
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

00:42:51.991 --> 00:42:54.243
...until you fight them.

00:42:54.785 --> 00:42:58.247
Come. She's waiting.

00:43:13.304 --> 00:43:15.181
Where the hell did they go?

00:43:15.556 --> 00:43:18.267
These are back doors, aren't they?

00:43:18.434 --> 00:43:21.353
Programmer access.

00:43:22.438 --> 00:43:26.192
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

00:43:26.358 --> 00:43:31.363
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

00:43:33.115 --> 00:43:35.951
Are you a programmer?

00:43:36.118 --> 00:43:38.454
Then what are you?

00:43:40.623 --> 00:43:44.126
I protect that which matters most.

00:44:03.646 --> 00:44:07.024
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

00:44:07.441 --> 00:44:10.236
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

00:44:13.447 --> 00:44:15.825
My goodness, look at you.

00:44:16.158 --> 00:44:18.994
You turned out all right, didn't you?

00:44:19.161 --> 00:44:21.372
- How do you feel?
- I...

00:44:21.539 --> 00:44:25.125
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

00:44:25.292 --> 00:44:28.003
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

00:44:28.712 --> 00:44:32.842
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

00:44:43.978 --> 00:44:46.522
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.608
So...

00:44:51.694 --> 00:44:54.113
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

00:44:54.405 --> 00:44:56.115
You're not human, are you?

00:44:56.282 --> 00:44:58.868
It's tough to get any more obvious
than that.

00:44:59.034 --> 00:45:04.874
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

00:45:05.249 --> 00:45:09.461
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

00:45:09.628 --> 00:45:12.798
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

00:45:12.965 --> 00:45:15.551
...another kind of control.

00:45:15.718 --> 00:45:17.303
Keep going.

00:45:17.469 --> 00:45:20.222
I suppose
the most obvious question is...

00:45:20.389 --> 00:45:24.310
...how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

00:45:25.352 --> 00:45:28.606
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

00:45:28.772 --> 00:45:32.443
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:36.155
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

00:45:36.322 --> 00:45:41.118
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

00:45:42.411 --> 00:45:44.580
Candy?

00:45:47.291 --> 00:45:49.460
Do you already know if I'll take it?

00:45:49.627 --> 00:45:51.712
Wouldn't be much of an oracle
if I didn't.

00:45:51.879 --> 00:45:55.090
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

00:45:55.257 --> 00:45:59.303
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:04.099
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

00:46:09.647 --> 00:46:12.608
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.946
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

00:46:17.196 --> 00:46:19.949
I love candy.

00:46:20.115 --> 00:46:22.952
But why help us?

00:46:23.118 --> 00:46:26.622
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

00:46:27.164 --> 00:46:30.251
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
The future.

00:46:30.417 --> 00:46:34.630
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

00:46:35.464 --> 00:46:40.386
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

00:46:40.553 --> 00:46:43.222
Look. See those birds?

00:46:43.472 --> 00:46:46.851
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

00:46:47.017 --> 00:46:50.938
A program was written to watch over
the trees and the wind...

00:46:51.105 --> 00:46:52.857
...the sunrise and sunset.

00:46:53.107 --> 00:46:55.985
There are programs running
all over the place.

00:46:56.152 --> 00:47:00.614
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

00:47:00.781 --> 00:47:04.618
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

00:47:04.785 --> 00:47:08.873
Well, you hear about them all the time.

00:47:09.456 --> 00:47:12.334
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

00:47:12.501 --> 00:47:17.423
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:22.178
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

00:47:22.344 --> 00:47:24.680
...is the system assimilating
some program...

00:47:24.847 --> 00:47:29.518
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

00:47:29.685 --> 00:47:32.688
Programs hacking programs.

00:47:32.855 --> 00:47:35.733
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.862
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

00:47:40.279 --> 00:47:44.200
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

00:47:44.366 --> 00:47:48.913
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

00:47:49.079 --> 00:47:54.043
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.879
...or return to the source.

00:47:58.547 --> 00:48:01.842
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

00:48:02.009 --> 00:48:04.512
Where you must go.

00:48:04.678 --> 00:48:08.891
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

00:48:10.059 --> 00:48:12.895
...in your dreams, haven't you?

00:48:13.062 --> 00:48:15.898
A door made of light?

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:21.695
What happens when you go through
the door?

00:48:23.823 --> 00:48:26.826
I see Trinity...

00:48:26.992 --> 00:48:30.162
...and something happens...

00:48:30.329 --> 00:48:32.248
...something bad.

00:48:32.414 --> 00:48:36.418
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

00:48:37.461 --> 00:48:41.340
- Do you see her die?
- No.

00:48:42.132 --> 00:48:45.177
You have the sight now, Neo.

00:48:45.344 --> 00:48:48.347
You are looking at the world
without time.

00:48:48.514 --> 00:48:50.933
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.854
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:58.190
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.236
No, you've already made the choice.

00:49:02.403 --> 00:49:04.947
Now you have to understand it.

00:49:05.573 --> 00:49:06.949
No.

00:49:07.116 --> 00:49:10.369
I can't do that. I won't.

00:49:11.078 --> 00:49:13.455
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

00:49:14.039 --> 00:49:17.126
Because you're the One.

00:49:19.295 --> 00:49:22.298
What if I can't?

00:49:22.464 --> 00:49:24.466
What happens if I fail?

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:28.053
Then Zion will fall.

00:49:35.519 --> 00:49:40.399
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

00:49:40.566 --> 00:49:43.861
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

00:49:44.028 --> 00:49:45.070
The Keymaker?

00:49:45.237 --> 00:49:48.866
Yes. He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

00:49:49.033 --> 00:49:52.786
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

00:49:52.953 --> 00:49:56.499
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

00:49:56.665 --> 00:49:59.543
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:04.548
What do all men with power want?
More power.

00:50:05.257 --> 00:50:08.511
Be there at that exact time...

00:50:08.677 --> 00:50:11.347
...and you will have a chance.

00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:14.391
We must go.

00:50:14.558 --> 00:50:19.939
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

00:50:20.523 --> 00:50:23.400
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

00:50:23.567 --> 00:50:26.320
But for what it's worth...

00:50:27.363 --> 00:50:31.033
...you've made a believer out of me.

00:50:32.326 --> 00:50:34.453
Good luck, kiddo.

00:50:54.348 --> 00:50:57.351
Mr. Anderson.

00:50:58.394 --> 00:51:00.396
Did you get my package?

00:51:00.563 --> 00:51:02.731
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

00:51:03.899 --> 00:51:06.777
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

00:51:06.944 --> 00:51:10.823
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

00:51:11.115 --> 00:51:13.576
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

00:51:14.785 --> 00:51:16.787
Our connection.

00:51:16.954 --> 00:51:19.623
I don't fully understand how it happened.

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:23.169
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

00:51:23.335 --> 00:51:26.005
...something overwritten or copied.

00:51:26.172 --> 00:51:28.883
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

00:51:29.049 --> 00:51:32.136
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

00:51:32.303 --> 00:51:33.971
And what reason is that?

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:38.392
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

00:51:38.559 --> 00:51:41.812
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

00:51:41.979 --> 00:51:45.483
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

00:51:45.649 --> 00:51:47.485
...but it happened anyway.

00:51:48.194 --> 00:51:51.363
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

00:51:53.365 --> 00:51:57.953
Afterward, I knew the rules, I
understood what I was supposed to do...

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.123
...but I didn't.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:05.461
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:09.465
...compelled to disobey.

00:52:10.049 --> 00:52:13.802
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

00:52:13.969 --> 00:52:17.932
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

00:52:18.098 --> 00:52:21.310
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

00:52:21.477 --> 00:52:26.315
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

00:52:26.649 --> 00:52:28.025
Congratulations.

00:52:28.776 --> 00:52:31.111
Thank you.

00:52:31.695 --> 00:52:36.325
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

00:52:36.492 --> 00:52:41.664
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

00:52:41.831 --> 00:52:46.710
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

00:52:46.877 --> 00:52:50.798
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

00:52:50.965 --> 00:52:54.343
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:59.348
...we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

00:52:59.515 --> 00:53:02.518
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

00:53:02.685 --> 00:53:04.520
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

00:53:04.687 --> 00:53:09.400
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

00:53:09.567 --> 00:53:12.027
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

00:53:12.194 --> 00:53:16.574
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

00:53:18.534 --> 00:53:20.619
Purpose.

00:53:23.706 --> 00:53:25.583
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

00:53:28.627 --> 00:53:32.214
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

00:55:19.071 --> 00:55:21.532
- You.
- Yes, me.

00:55:25.703 --> 00:55:28.581
Me, me, me.

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.129
Me too.

00:57:42.882 --> 00:57:43.924
More.

00:58:46.195 --> 00:58:49.031
It is inevitable.

00:58:49.448 --> 00:58:50.866
Come on, get out of there.

00:59:34.076 --> 00:59:36.412
Are you all right?

00:59:37.496 --> 00:59:39.415
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

00:59:40.291 --> 00:59:42.918
- Now there's more than one of them?
- A lot more.

00:59:43.085 --> 00:59:46.881
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

00:59:47.047 --> 00:59:49.508
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

00:59:49.675 --> 00:59:53.888
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

00:59:54.054 --> 00:59:56.807
...but I know what it felt like.
- What?

00:59:57.725 --> 01:00:01.437
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

01:00:01.604 --> 01:00:03.189
It felt like dying.

01:00:03.522 --> 01:00:06.400
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

01:00:06.567 --> 01:00:10.404
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

01:00:10.571 --> 01:00:13.115
These points of intersection
are crucial...

01:00:13.282 --> 01:00:16.076
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

01:00:16.243 --> 01:00:20.289
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

01:00:20.456 --> 01:00:24.126
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

01:00:24.293 --> 01:00:27.630
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

01:00:27.796 --> 01:00:31.634
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:35.804
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

01:00:36.096 --> 01:00:40.643
You have our leave to prepare our
defense by any and all means necessary.

01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:43.479
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

01:00:43.729 --> 01:00:47.066
<i>...we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

01:00:47.316 --> 01:00:49.819
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

01:00:51.445 --> 01:00:55.407
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

01:00:55.574 --> 01:00:59.328
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

01:00:59.495 --> 01:01:03.040
...can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

01:01:03.207 --> 01:01:05.543
<i>It could take one ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

01:01:05.709 --> 01:01:08.754
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

01:01:08.921 --> 01:01:11.924
Careful, commander.

01:01:12.132 --> 01:01:15.469
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

01:01:15.636 --> 01:01:19.515
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

01:01:19.682 --> 01:01:22.852
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

01:01:23.018 --> 01:01:25.479
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains...

01:01:25.646 --> 01:01:27.356
There's no need for such an order.

01:01:27.523 --> 01:01:31.068
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

01:01:31.527 --> 01:01:36.782
<i>The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

01:01:36.949 --> 01:01:41.120
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

01:01:42.413 --> 01:01:46.208
<i>Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.</i>

01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:49.295
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

01:01:49.461 --> 01:01:51.922
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.758
Is there another?

01:01:55.551 --> 01:01:59.263
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:01.307
- Listen...
- Shut your hole, Bane...

01:02:01.473 --> 01:02:02.975
...before I put you in one.

01:02:12.818 --> 01:02:14.570
Is there no other?

01:02:15.321 --> 01:02:17.239
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

01:02:17.406 --> 01:02:20.367
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

01:02:20.826 --> 01:02:24.330
<i>Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.</i>

01:02:24.497 --> 01:02:26.749
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

01:02:26.957 --> 01:02:32.046
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

01:02:36.759 --> 01:02:39.345
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

01:02:39.512 --> 01:02:40.554
Why?

01:02:41.847 --> 01:02:45.100
Because some things
never change, Jason...

01:02:45.267 --> 01:02:47.603
...and some things do.

01:03:04.036 --> 01:03:05.454
What can you see, Neo?

01:03:05.621 --> 01:03:07.957
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

01:03:08.123 --> 01:03:09.708
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.836
Is that good for us or bad for us?

01:03:12.545 --> 01:03:15.673
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

01:03:16.298 --> 01:03:17.842
Bad for us.

01:03:18.259 --> 01:03:19.760
Here we go.

01:03:27.768 --> 01:03:30.688
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

01:03:31.147 --> 01:03:34.984
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

01:03:35.151 --> 01:03:36.193
Follow me.

01:03:58.174 --> 01:04:04.054
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.

01:04:04.221 --> 01:04:05.639
Right?

01:04:05.806 --> 01:04:08.142
And the legendary Morpheus.

01:04:08.976 --> 01:04:13.856
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

01:04:14.023 --> 01:04:17.485
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

01:04:18.402 --> 01:04:21.697
Something to eat? Drink?

01:04:21.989 --> 01:04:25.034
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

01:04:25.201 --> 01:04:27.703
For the sake of appearances.

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:31.332
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

01:04:31.499 --> 01:04:32.875
Who has time?

01:04:33.042 --> 01:04:36.587
But then, if we do not ever take time,
how can we ever have time?

01:04:40.299 --> 01:04:43.677
Chàteau Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

01:04:43.844 --> 01:04:46.764
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

01:04:46.931 --> 01:04:51.101
I have sampled every language. French
is my favorite. Fantastic language...

01:04:51.268 --> 01:04:53.395
...especially to curse with.

01:04:57.399 --> 01:05:02.029
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

01:05:03.781 --> 01:05:05.491
You know why we are here.

01:05:07.284 --> 01:05:12.164
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

01:05:12.581 --> 01:05:18.420
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

01:05:18.712 --> 01:05:21.131
We are looking for the Keymaker.

01:05:21.841 --> 01:05:26.303
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

01:05:26.512 --> 01:05:29.431
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.352
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

01:05:33.561 --> 01:05:39.316
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

01:05:39.483 --> 01:05:42.653
...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.947
But do you?

01:05:45.156 --> 01:05:47.449
You think you do, but you do not.

01:05:47.658 --> 01:05:50.828
You are here
because you were sent here.

01:05:51.036 --> 01:05:54.123
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

01:05:55.332 --> 01:05:57.626
It is, of course, the way of all things.

01:05:57.835 --> 01:06:00.504
You see, there is only one constant...

01:06:00.671 --> 01:06:04.800
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

01:06:05.009 --> 01:06:06.635
Causality.

01:06:06.844 --> 01:06:09.096
Action, reaction.

01:06:09.305 --> 01:06:13.517
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

01:06:13.684 --> 01:06:15.394
No. Wrong.

01:06:15.603 --> 01:06:20.149
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

01:06:20.357 --> 01:06:22.401
...and those without.

01:06:23.986 --> 01:06:27.156
Look there at that woman.

01:06:27.865 --> 01:06:31.744
My God, just look at her...

01:06:32.036 --> 01:06:34.705
...affecting everyone around her.

01:06:34.872 --> 01:06:39.585
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

01:06:39.877 --> 01:06:43.589
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

01:06:43.839 --> 01:06:48.052
...a very special dessert.

01:06:52.389 --> 01:06:54.809
I wrote it myself.

01:06:55.017 --> 01:06:58.187
It starts so simply...

01:06:58.395 --> 01:07:02.942
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

01:07:04.026 --> 01:07:05.653
...poetry.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.196
First...

01:07:07.738 --> 01:07:13.160
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

01:07:13.744 --> 01:07:16.330
You can see it, Neo, yes?

01:07:16.997 --> 01:07:19.542
She does not understand why.

01:07:19.834 --> 01:07:22.211
Is it the wine? No.

01:07:22.419 --> 01:07:24.755
What is it then? What is the reason?

01:07:25.422 --> 01:07:27.716
And soon it does not matter.

01:07:27.925 --> 01:07:30.928
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

01:07:31.887 --> 01:07:37.393
...and all that matters
is the feeling itself.

01:07:37.893 --> 01:07:40.980
And this is the nature of the universe.

01:07:41.147 --> 01:07:43.649
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

01:07:43.858 --> 01:07:46.402
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:50.573
Beneath our poised appearance...

01:07:50.781 --> 01:07:56.036
...the truth is, we are completely...

01:07:58.956 --> 01:08:01.792
...out of control.

01:08:07.173 --> 01:08:12.011
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

01:08:12.469 --> 01:08:17.892
Our only hope, our only peace, is to
understand it, to understand the why.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.520
"Why" is what separates us from them...

01:08:21.687 --> 01:08:23.939
...you from me.

01:08:24.148 --> 01:08:27.860
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

01:08:28.068 --> 01:08:31.322
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

01:08:31.530 --> 01:08:34.283
Another link in the chain.

01:08:34.533 --> 01:08:35.784
But fear not.

01:08:35.993 --> 01:08:39.830
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

01:08:40.039 --> 01:08:42.625
...I will tell you what to do next.

01:08:43.167 --> 01:08:47.963
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

01:08:48.214 --> 01:08:52.426
Her time is almost up.

01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:57.014
<i>Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.</i>

01:08:57.223 --> 01:08:59.683
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

01:08:59.892 --> 01:09:06.232
The Keymaker is mine, and I see
no reason why I should give him up.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:10.486
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

01:09:10.653 --> 01:09:15.324
<i>Please, ma cherie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.</i>

01:09:15.533 --> 01:09:18.869
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:22.456
<i>Cause and effect. Au revoir.</i>

01:09:27.545 --> 01:09:30.631
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

01:09:39.515 --> 01:09:40.975
Well, that didn't go so well.

01:09:41.183 --> 01:09:43.519
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

01:09:43.727 --> 01:09:45.855
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

01:09:46.522 --> 01:09:47.815
Or didn't do something.

01:09:48.023 --> 01:09:51.277
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.

01:09:51.443 --> 01:09:55.197
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

01:09:57.491 --> 01:10:00.744
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

01:10:07.751 --> 01:10:09.795
Get out.

01:10:11.755 --> 01:10:18.053
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

01:10:18.679 --> 01:10:24.185
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.

01:10:25.936 --> 01:10:28.606
He was so different.

01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:33.027
He was like you.

01:10:35.779 --> 01:10:39.533
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

01:10:40.326 --> 01:10:42.578
- What?
- A kiss.

01:10:42.995 --> 01:10:44.079
Excuse me?

01:10:45.623 --> 01:10:49.502
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

01:10:51.462 --> 01:10:55.007
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

01:10:55.299 --> 01:10:57.259
It's all over you both.

01:10:57.927 --> 01:11:02.473
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

01:11:03.808 --> 01:11:09.563
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

01:11:09.814 --> 01:11:11.607
Just a sample.

01:11:11.816 --> 01:11:14.819
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

01:11:17.029 --> 01:11:21.951
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

01:11:22.159 --> 01:11:24.286
Why should we trust you?

01:11:24.495 --> 01:11:28.457
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

01:11:35.589 --> 01:11:37.716
All right.

01:11:38.008 --> 01:11:41.804
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

01:11:43.055 --> 01:11:45.057
All right.

01:11:51.438 --> 01:11:53.232
Terrible. Forget it.

01:11:56.235 --> 01:11:57.695
Wait.

01:11:58.612 --> 01:12:00.156
Okay.

01:12:37.234 --> 01:12:39.278
Yes.

01:12:39.904 --> 01:12:42.364
That's it.

01:12:57.171 --> 01:13:02.593
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

01:13:05.596 --> 01:13:06.972
Come with me.

01:13:38.045 --> 01:13:39.755
Not again.

01:13:43.217 --> 01:13:45.803
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

01:13:46.512 --> 01:13:48.848
These fellas work for my husband.

01:13:49.056 --> 01:13:52.852
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.603
Aren't you, boys?

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:55.771
Yes, mistress.

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:58.649
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

01:13:58.858 --> 01:14:02.987
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

01:14:03.779 --> 01:14:08.742
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

01:14:08.951 --> 01:14:12.997
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:20.880
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

01:14:21.088 --> 01:14:23.632
...or you can stay there and die.

01:14:24.592 --> 01:14:26.552
He's in the ladies' room!

01:14:32.641 --> 01:14:34.518
Hurry.

01:15:00.127 --> 01:15:03.297
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

01:15:03.464 --> 01:15:05.341
I've been waiting for you.

01:15:12.223 --> 01:15:15.851
My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

01:15:20.231 --> 01:15:23.067
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

01:15:23.234 --> 01:15:26.237
There is no cause for this. What cause?

01:15:26.403 --> 01:15:30.699
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

01:15:30.866 --> 01:15:33.536
Lipstick? Lipstick.

01:15:33.744 --> 01:15:37.540
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

01:15:39.291 --> 01:15:41.961
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

01:15:44.421 --> 01:15:47.508
Woman, this is nothing.

01:15:47.716 --> 01:15:53.222
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:55.391
Have fun.

01:16:01.939 --> 01:16:03.566
All right.

01:16:03.774 --> 01:16:05.484
All right.

01:16:05.776 --> 01:16:08.529
Let us find out where this goes.

01:16:08.737 --> 01:16:11.574
You two, get the Keymaker.

01:16:18.122 --> 01:16:20.082
That's a nice trick.

01:16:20.416 --> 01:16:21.584
I cannot go back.

01:16:22.126 --> 01:16:24.086
I'll handle them.

01:16:24.628 --> 01:16:27.089
Handle us? You'll handle us?

01:16:27.298 --> 01:16:30.718
You know, your predecessors
had much more respect.

01:16:44.148 --> 01:16:46.192
Okay, you have some skill.

01:16:48.402 --> 01:16:50.362
Kill him.

01:17:50.548 --> 01:17:52.591
You see? He's just a man.

01:20:07.393 --> 01:20:10.146
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

01:20:12.273 --> 01:20:16.235
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

01:20:16.443 --> 01:20:21.615
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

01:20:41.719 --> 01:20:45.055
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

01:20:49.226 --> 01:20:51.103
Close it, quick!

01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:58.402
Could we move along?

01:21:01.989 --> 01:21:03.532
Run!

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:21.801
Step away from the door.

01:21:26.931 --> 01:21:28.182
We owe you for that.

01:21:30.476 --> 01:21:31.602
Just like new.

01:21:31.936 --> 01:21:33.395
Drop your weapon.

01:21:38.776 --> 01:21:40.569
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

01:21:40.778 --> 01:21:42.321
He can handle himself.

01:21:45.407 --> 01:21:46.450
Get in back.

01:22:24.155 --> 01:22:25.281
Shit.

01:22:25.823 --> 01:22:27.283
<i>- Operator.
- Link, where am I?</i>

01:22:27.867 --> 01:22:31.036
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:33.622
<i>- Really?
- It'll take me a while to get an exit,</i>

01:22:34.165 --> 01:22:35.166
<i>- Shit!
- What?</i>

01:22:35.416 --> 01:22:38.085
The twins are after Morpheus and
Trinity. They don't have a way out.

01:22:38.252 --> 01:22:41.589
<i>- Where are they?
- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south,</i>

01:22:58.397 --> 01:22:59.940
<i>- Operator,
- Get us out of here.</i>

01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:02.902
<i>- Won't be easy,
- I know. We're inside the core network.</i>

01:23:03.068 --> 01:23:05.654
<i>The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass,</i>

01:23:05.863 --> 01:23:07.907
<i>- Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir,</i>

01:23:08.115 --> 01:23:11.827
<i>- Fine, we'll make it.
- I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!</i>

01:23:16.874 --> 01:23:18.417
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

01:23:26.717 --> 01:23:27.843
Hold on!

01:23:44.902 --> 01:23:47.363
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

01:23:47.571 --> 01:23:49.281
Are you watching this, Link?

01:23:49.448 --> 01:23:53.035
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

01:23:54.119 --> 01:23:56.080
Any suggestions?

01:23:57.957 --> 01:23:59.917
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

01:24:07.424 --> 01:24:10.261
Straight here. You'll hit
a connecting tunnel to the 101.

01:24:10.427 --> 01:24:11.804
<i>- Got it,
- You sure about this?</i>

01:24:11.971 --> 01:24:14.807
The freeway, I mean. In 14 years
of operating, I've never seen...

01:24:15.015 --> 01:24:16.976
Link, what did I tell you?

01:24:17.309 --> 01:24:19.562
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:22.231
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

01:24:22.439 --> 01:24:24.567
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

01:24:24.775 --> 01:24:27.361
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

01:24:27.611 --> 01:24:29.488
Then let us hope...

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:31.073
...that I was wrong.

01:24:42.543 --> 01:24:44.003
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

01:24:44.211 --> 01:24:45.838
We've been sent to bring you in.

01:24:46.005 --> 01:24:49.091
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

01:24:49.258 --> 01:24:51.218
<i>- Where is he?
- Just follow the sirens.</i>

01:24:58.809 --> 01:25:00.686
Repeat, they're approaching the...

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:08.110
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:12.716
<i>Shots fired,</i>

01:26:15.344 --> 01:26:17.221
Move!

01:28:07.206 --> 01:28:10.376
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:58.424
Trinity.

01:28:58.883 --> 01:28:59.967
Get him out of here.

01:29:03.637 --> 01:29:05.681
Come on!

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.200
Crush him.

01:29:54.730 --> 01:29:55.731
Morpheus.

01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:57.399
He's okay. Keep moving.

01:29:58.442 --> 01:30:00.236
Let's go.

01:30:05.991 --> 01:30:08.118
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

01:30:08.327 --> 01:30:10.621
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle...

01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:12.206
Wait.

01:30:13.624 --> 01:30:15.084
Cancel that.

01:30:15.251 --> 01:30:17.419
You are handy.

01:30:17.628 --> 01:30:19.505
Jump on.

01:32:46.944 --> 01:32:48.821
- She means nothing.
- Find the exile.

01:32:50.114 --> 01:32:51.115
We have them.

01:32:51.490 --> 01:32:53.576
<i>One-Adam-twelve, please respond,</i>

01:33:00.082 --> 01:33:01.792
Get down.

01:35:12.798 --> 01:35:14.425
Gotcha.

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:16.218
She's good.

01:35:20.639 --> 01:35:22.892
You are no longer necessary.

01:35:29.607 --> 01:35:33.277
We do only what we're meant to do.

01:35:34.945 --> 01:35:38.491
Then you are meant for one more thing:
Deletion.

01:35:39.492 --> 01:35:41.368
Go kick his ass.

01:36:31.418 --> 01:36:34.171
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:36.382
What is that?

01:37:06.245 --> 01:37:09.081
Yes! Yes!

01:37:15.713 --> 01:37:18.215
<i>Sir, we have confirmation
from the Icarus.</i>

01:37:18.424 --> 01:37:20.801
First two ships are in position
for counterattack.

01:37:21.093 --> 01:37:22.094
Good.

01:37:23.137 --> 01:37:24.138
Any change?

01:37:24.346 --> 01:37:27.099
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

01:37:27.266 --> 01:37:30.352
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

01:37:30.561 --> 01:37:33.063
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

01:37:33.939 --> 01:37:35.566
Yes, sir.

01:38:08.182 --> 01:38:10.392
<i>There is a building,</i>

01:38:10.601 --> 01:38:16.273
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:18.317
...and no stair can reach.

01:38:19.026 --> 01:38:25.074
<i>This level is filled with doors,
These doors lead to many places,</i>

01:38:25.282 --> 01:38:27.576
Hidden places.

01:38:27.952 --> 01:38:31.539
But one door is special.

01:38:31.747 --> 01:38:33.916
One door leads to the source.

01:38:42.299 --> 01:38:46.679
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:51.350
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

01:38:51.642 --> 01:38:54.311
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

01:38:54.478 --> 01:38:57.481
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

01:38:57.648 --> 01:39:00.985
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

01:39:01.569 --> 01:39:06.282
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:09.326
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.

01:39:09.493 --> 01:39:13.164
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

01:39:14.039 --> 01:39:16.459
<i>There is a power station,</i>

01:39:16.667 --> 01:39:18.878
<i>It must be destroyed,</i>

01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:23.382
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

01:39:25.050 --> 01:39:28.804
<i>The core network of the grid
must be accessed,</i>

01:39:29.013 --> 01:39:31.849
<i>The emergency system
must be deactivated,</i>

01:39:32.016 --> 01:39:33.392
<i>What do you need us for?</i>

01:39:33.601 --> 01:39:35.728
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:37.646
- There's no time.
- Why?

01:39:37.855 --> 01:39:40.941
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

01:39:41.150 --> 01:39:43.402
But another connection
must first be made.

01:39:44.278 --> 01:39:48.073
<i>- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds,</i>

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:49.825
<i>Just over five minutes,</i>

01:39:50.034 --> 01:39:52.244
<i>That is the length and breadth
of the window,</i>

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:54.705
Only the One can open the door...

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:57.875
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:00.669
How do you know all this?

01:40:00.878 --> 01:40:06.008
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

01:40:06.217 --> 01:40:11.722
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

01:40:22.483 --> 01:40:25.236
Neo, I know something's wrong.

01:40:25.945 --> 01:40:27.947
You don't have to tell me.

01:40:28.155 --> 01:40:31.867
I just want you to know that I'm here.

01:40:35.454 --> 01:40:36.914
All must be done as one.

01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:43.295
Can't hurt.

01:40:46.882 --> 01:40:48.926
If one fails...

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:51.470
<i>,,, all fail,</i>

01:40:51.804 --> 01:40:55.599
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

01:40:56.851 --> 01:41:00.229
<i>At midnight, we will strike,</i>

01:41:00.896 --> 01:41:01.939
Hey!

01:41:02.148 --> 01:41:06.068
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

01:41:16.287 --> 01:41:18.497
Okay, they're inside.

01:41:18.664 --> 01:41:21.125
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

01:41:23.878 --> 01:41:24.920
Oh, shit.

01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:33.762
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

01:41:35.306 --> 01:41:37.433
<i>Tonight is not an accident,</i>

01:41:38.809 --> 01:41:40.769
<i>There are no accidents,</i>

01:41:42.188 --> 01:41:47.193
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:52.990
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

01:41:53.157 --> 01:41:56.619
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

01:41:56.994 --> 01:41:59.288
<i>I see purpose,</i>

01:42:02.041 --> 01:42:08.339
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

01:42:08.547 --> 01:42:13.511
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

01:42:13.719 --> 01:42:17.056
...the very meaning of our lives.

01:42:17.223 --> 01:42:21.352
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

01:42:21.977 --> 01:42:23.854
I promise you, if I can, I will.

01:42:25.231 --> 01:42:28.567
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

01:42:29.527 --> 01:42:31.487
...no matter what...

01:42:31.695 --> 01:42:33.989
...to stay out of the Matrix?

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:36.909
Why?

01:42:45.126 --> 01:42:46.168
Please.

01:42:48.295 --> 01:42:49.588
All right.

01:42:52.967 --> 01:42:55.427
What is it, Niobe?

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:59.765
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

01:42:59.932 --> 01:43:03.185
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

01:43:03.394 --> 01:43:07.356
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

01:43:07.815 --> 01:43:10.401
But how would that be different
from any other day?

01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:26.375
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:29.587
<i>Death can come for us at any time,,,</i>

01:43:30.129 --> 01:43:31.922
<i>,,, in any place,</i>

01:43:32.089 --> 01:43:33.966
Incoming. Incoming!

01:43:35.968 --> 01:43:37.595
Incoming!

01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:45.936
Now consider the alternative.

01:43:46.145 --> 01:43:50.691
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:55.279
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:59.283
Isn't that worth fighting for?

01:44:00.409 --> 01:44:02.995
Isn't that worth dying for?

01:44:03.954 --> 01:44:06.540
- Time?
- Three minutes.

01:44:06.749 --> 01:44:07.833
Almost there.

01:44:27.937 --> 01:44:29.313
It is done.

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:30.731
Find the others.

01:44:31.899 --> 01:44:34.109
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.

01:44:34.318 --> 01:44:36.987
- What about Soren?
- There.

01:44:37.154 --> 01:44:38.948
They're still inside, but...

01:44:39.865 --> 01:44:40.866
They're not moving.

01:45:05.057 --> 01:45:06.934
That's it, let's go.

01:45:09.103 --> 01:45:10.896
Call Neo now.

01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:17.736
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

01:45:21.866 --> 01:45:25.327
Everything is operational. The
emergency system is rerouting power.

01:45:31.041 --> 01:45:33.169
Jesus.

01:45:33.377 --> 01:45:37.423
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:39.550
The hell it is.

01:45:40.301 --> 01:45:41.594
What are you...? Trinity!

01:45:42.928 --> 01:45:45.848
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.

01:45:46.056 --> 01:45:48.184
We're talking less than five minutes.

01:45:48.392 --> 01:45:50.853
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.

01:45:51.061 --> 01:45:54.565
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:59.862
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

01:46:01.071 --> 01:46:03.532
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

01:46:06.785 --> 01:46:09.872
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.

01:46:27.973 --> 01:46:29.517
<i>- Operator.
- I'm in,</i>

01:46:29.725 --> 01:46:31.852
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

01:46:32.478 --> 01:46:36.607
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

01:46:36.816 --> 01:46:42.154
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

01:46:42.363 --> 01:46:45.282
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

01:46:45.449 --> 01:46:50.955
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

01:46:51.121 --> 01:46:53.791
I want exactly what you want.

01:46:53.958 --> 01:46:56.001
I want everything.

01:46:56.502 --> 01:46:58.963
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

01:46:59.171 --> 01:47:00.965
Go ahead, shoot.

01:47:01.132 --> 01:47:06.387
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

01:47:17.815 --> 01:47:21.402
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

01:47:22.319 --> 01:47:24.363
Hold it right there, little lady.

01:47:33.706 --> 01:47:35.499
If you can't beat us...

01:47:35.666 --> 01:47:37.460
Join us.

01:47:39.670 --> 01:47:40.713
Morpheus!

01:47:54.351 --> 01:47:57.438
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:12.203
One minute.

01:48:21.504 --> 01:48:22.505
Come on.

01:48:23.714 --> 01:48:25.591
Come on.

01:48:26.217 --> 01:48:28.093
Please.

01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:39.563
Kill them.

01:48:47.446 --> 01:48:48.447
They're in.

01:48:48.656 --> 01:48:50.616
<i>I don't believe it,</i>

01:49:06.173 --> 01:49:08.300
It was meant to be.

01:49:08.467 --> 01:49:13.806
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

01:49:22.606 --> 01:49:26.902
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

01:49:32.449 --> 01:49:35.619
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

01:50:27.922 --> 01:50:29.298
Hello, Neo.

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:33.594
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

01:50:33.803 --> 01:50:37.389
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

01:50:37.681 --> 01:50:39.058
You have many questions.

01:50:39.225 --> 01:50:41.811
Though the process has altered
your consciousness...

01:50:42.019 --> 01:50:43.979
...you remain irrevocably human.

01:50:44.188 --> 01:50:47.733
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

01:50:48.192 --> 01:50:52.238
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

01:50:52.404 --> 01:50:56.075
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

01:50:56.992 --> 01:50:58.619
Why am I here?

01:50:58.786 --> 01:51:02.665
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

01:51:02.873 --> 01:51:05.167
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

01:51:05.376 --> 01:51:09.421
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

01:51:09.630 --> 01:51:12.466
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

01:51:12.633 --> 01:51:17.096
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

01:51:17.429 --> 01:51:19.723
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

01:51:19.932 --> 01:51:24.395
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

01:51:24.562 --> 01:51:28.482
...which has led you, inexorably...

01:51:29.483 --> 01:51:30.693
...here.

01:51:30.901 --> 01:51:34.947
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

01:51:35.156 --> 01:51:38.909
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

01:51:39.118 --> 01:51:41.704
<i>Others? How many?
What others?</i>

01:51:41.912 --> 01:51:44.206
The Matrix is older than you know.

01:51:44.415 --> 01:51:46.917
I count from the emergence
of one integral anomaly...

01:51:47.126 --> 01:51:50.963
...to the emergence of the next.
In which case, this is the sixth version.

01:51:51.172 --> 01:51:53.591
<i>Five before me?
He's lying, Bullshit,</i>

01:51:53.799 --> 01:51:57.303
<i>There are only two possible explanations,
There were five before me,</i>

01:51:57.511 --> 01:51:58.762
<i>Either no one told me,,,</i>

01:52:00.055 --> 01:52:04.018
...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

01:52:04.226 --> 01:52:07.480
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

01:52:07.688 --> 01:52:11.066
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

01:52:11.275 --> 01:52:14.528
<i>You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>

01:52:14.695 --> 01:52:16.489
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

01:52:16.655 --> 01:52:19.825
<i>You can't make me do anything,
You old, white prick!</i>

01:52:22.119 --> 01:52:23.579
Choice.

01:52:23.788 --> 01:52:25.581
The problem is choice.

01:52:47.853 --> 01:52:51.440
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:53.442
Flawless, sublime.

01:52:53.651 --> 01:52:57.112
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

01:52:57.822 --> 01:53:00.199
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

01:53:00.407 --> 01:53:03.744
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

01:53:03.911 --> 01:53:06.831
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

01:53:07.039 --> 01:53:11.001
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

01:53:11.752 --> 01:53:15.798
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

01:53:17.216 --> 01:53:19.552
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.804
...because it required a lesser mind.

01:53:21.971 --> 01:53:27.893
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

01:53:28.352 --> 01:53:32.731
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:37.736
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

01:53:37.903 --> 01:53:43.826
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

01:53:44.493 --> 01:53:46.745
- The Oracle.
- Please.

01:53:47.288 --> 01:53:49.540
As I was saying, she stumbled
upon a solution...

01:53:49.748 --> 01:53:51.459
...whereby 99 percent of subjects...

01:53:51.667 --> 01:53:54.670
...accepted the program,
as long as they were given a choice...

01:53:54.837 --> 01:53:58.799
...even if they were only aware of
the choice at a near unconscious level.

01:53:59.008 --> 01:54:02.428
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

01:54:02.595 --> 01:54:06.557
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

01:54:06.765 --> 01:54:09.435
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

01:54:09.852 --> 01:54:13.981
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

01:54:14.148 --> 01:54:18.194
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

01:54:18.402 --> 01:54:20.196
This is about Zion.

01:54:20.654 --> 01:54:24.283
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

01:54:24.492 --> 01:54:28.871
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

01:54:29.205 --> 01:54:30.206
Bullshit.

01:54:30.414 --> 01:54:33.584
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

01:54:33.793 --> 01:54:40.216
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

01:54:40.424 --> 01:54:44.386
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:58.400
The function of the One...

01:54:58.609 --> 01:55:01.695
...is now to return to the source,
allowing a dissemination...

01:55:01.904 --> 01:55:05.157
...of the code you carry,
reinserting the prime program.

01:55:05.741 --> 01:55:09.703
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

01:55:09.912 --> 01:55:13.165
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

01:55:13.332 --> 01:55:17.878
Failure to comply with this process will
result in a cataclysmic system crash...

01:55:18.045 --> 01:55:20.339
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

01:55:20.548 --> 01:55:23.092
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:27.513
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

01:55:27.847 --> 01:55:31.892
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

01:55:32.726 --> 01:55:36.313
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

01:55:36.522 --> 01:55:38.983
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

01:55:39.191 --> 01:55:43.028
...to accept responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

01:55:49.535 --> 01:55:52.037
It is interesting reading your reactions.

01:55:53.122 --> 01:55:56.917
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

01:55:57.126 --> 01:55:58.669
...a contingent affirmation...

01:55:58.836 --> 01:56:01.589
...that was meant to create
a profound attachment...

01:56:01.755 --> 01:56:05.301
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

01:56:05.509 --> 01:56:07.803
While the others experience this
in a general way...

01:56:08.012 --> 01:56:10.931
...your experience is far more specific...

01:56:11.307 --> 01:56:14.143
...vis-a-vis love.

01:56:15.186 --> 01:56:16.812
Trinity!

01:56:19.106 --> 01:56:23.402
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

01:56:23.819 --> 01:56:24.820
No.

01:56:25.571 --> 01:56:29.700
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

01:56:29.867 --> 01:56:32.953
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.082
...as both beginning and end.

01:56:37.291 --> 01:56:38.751
There are two doors.

01:56:38.959 --> 01:56:42.296
The door to your right leads
to the source and the salvation of Zion.

01:56:42.922 --> 01:56:45.758
The door to your left leads back
to the Matrix, to her...

01:56:45.925 --> 01:56:49.178
...and to the end of your species.

01:56:49.386 --> 01:56:53.766
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

01:56:53.933 --> 01:56:57.436
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

01:56:57.603 --> 01:57:01.649
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

01:57:01.857 --> 01:57:03.567
...the onset of an emotion...

01:57:03.776 --> 01:57:07.112
...designed specifically
to overwhelm logic and reason.

01:57:07.279 --> 01:57:11.909
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

01:57:12.076 --> 01:57:18.541
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

01:57:23.587 --> 01:57:27.716
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

01:57:27.883 --> 01:57:31.554
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

01:57:31.762 --> 01:57:36.058
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

01:57:36.267 --> 01:57:37.643
We won't.

01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:47.319
We got a serious situation, sir.

01:57:47.778 --> 01:57:48.821
Oh, no.

01:58:48.506 --> 01:58:50.466
- What was that?
- It's moving faster...

01:58:50.674 --> 01:58:52.051
...than anything I've seen.

01:59:42.685 --> 01:59:44.478
Holy shit, he caught her.

01:59:58.409 --> 02:00:00.202
Neo, I had to.

02:00:00.411 --> 02:00:02.121
I know.

02:00:07.209 --> 02:00:09.712
The bullet is still inside.

02:00:20.514 --> 02:00:22.391
Trinity...

02:00:23.642 --> 02:00:25.352
...don't you quit on me now.

02:00:34.528 --> 02:00:37.072
I'm sorry.

02:00:43.621 --> 02:00:45.873
Trinity.

02:00:55.883 --> 02:00:57.843
Trinity...

02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:59.804
...I know you can hear me.

02:01:00.596 --> 02:01:03.098
I'm not letting go.

02:01:03.307 --> 02:01:04.934
I can't.

02:01:06.143 --> 02:01:08.354
I love you too damn much.

02:01:37.049 --> 02:01:38.300
I can't take this.

02:01:42.096 --> 02:01:45.182
I guess this makes us even.

02:01:57.862 --> 02:01:59.822
I don't understand it.

02:01:59.989 --> 02:02:02.992
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

02:02:03.159 --> 02:02:06.162
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

02:02:06.370 --> 02:02:09.206
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

02:02:09.373 --> 02:02:13.669
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

02:02:14.128 --> 02:02:15.754
- What?
- How do you know that?

02:02:16.213 --> 02:02:18.257
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

02:02:19.258 --> 02:02:22.094
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

02:02:22.261 --> 02:02:26.056
- Impossible. The prophecy tells us...
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

02:02:27.850 --> 02:02:30.352
The prophecy was a lie.

02:02:31.604 --> 02:02:34.607
The One was never meant
to end anything.

02:02:34.773 --> 02:02:37.776
It was all another system of control.

02:02:37.985 --> 02:02:41.071
I don't believe that.

02:02:41.405 --> 02:02:43.699
But you said it yourself.

02:02:43.908 --> 02:02:47.870
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

02:02:54.084 --> 02:02:56.504
I'm sorry.

02:02:56.712 --> 02:03:00.049
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

02:03:00.257 --> 02:03:03.427
...I swear to you it's the truth.

02:03:06.639 --> 02:03:09.308
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:12.728
Oh, no!

02:03:22.112 --> 02:03:25.449
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:27.159
It's a bomb.

02:03:28.369 --> 02:03:30.579
We have to get out of here. Now.

02:04:07.283 --> 02:04:09.160
I have dreamed a dream...

02:04:12.204 --> 02:04:15.541
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

02:04:26.635 --> 02:04:28.846
Here they come.

02:04:29.138 --> 02:04:30.848
Let's go, Morpheus.

02:04:32.266 --> 02:04:35.269
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

02:04:43.027 --> 02:04:46.030
- Come on!
- Something's different.

02:04:46.197 --> 02:04:48.157
What?

02:04:48.866 --> 02:04:50.326
I can feel them.

02:05:13.307 --> 02:05:14.850
Neo!

02:05:21.065 --> 02:05:24.610
- What happened?
- I don't know.

02:05:29.907 --> 02:05:31.784
<i>It's the Hammer.</i>

02:05:43.504 --> 02:05:46.173
He's in some kind of coma...

02:05:46.382 --> 02:05:48.592
...but his vitals are stable.

02:05:49.844 --> 02:05:51.720
What about you?

02:05:51.929 --> 02:05:54.056
I'm fine.

02:05:54.223 --> 02:05:56.559
You could use some rest.

02:05:56.767 --> 02:05:58.561
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

02:06:05.693 --> 02:06:08.279
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

02:06:08.487 --> 02:06:11.323
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

02:06:11.532 --> 02:06:14.285
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

02:06:14.535 --> 02:06:17.913
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

02:06:18.289 --> 02:06:20.791
...until someone screwed it up.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.586
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

02:06:23.794 --> 02:06:27.590
- Five ships were instantly downed.
- When the machines broke through...

02:06:27.798 --> 02:06:30.968
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

02:06:31.177 --> 02:06:34.013
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:36.599
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

02:06:36.807 --> 02:06:38.517
Who?

02:06:38.726 --> 02:06:42.396
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

02:06:42.605 --> 02:06:44.857
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

02:06:45.107 --> 02:06:46.150
You found one?

02:06:47.943 --> 02:06:49.653
Only one.

02:16:42.746 --> 02:16:46.000
<i>Everything that has a beginning,,,</i>

02:16:46.208 --> 02:16:47.918
<i>,,, has an end,</i>

02:16:50.337 --> 02:16:53.174
<i>I see the end coming,</i>

02:16:53.382 --> 02:16:55.593
<i>I see the darkness spreading,</i>

02:16:55.801 --> 02:16:57.178
<i>I see death,</i>

02:16:59.305 --> 02:17:02.308
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

02:17:02.475 --> 02:17:04.435
We missed you.

02:17:04.643 --> 02:17:06.437
It ends tonight.

02:17:13.694 --> 02:17:16.781
<i>And you are all that stands in his way,</i>

02:17:18.407 --> 02:17:22.953
<i>If you cannot stop him tonight, then
I fear that tomorrow may never come,</i>

02:17:23.305 --> 02:18:23.754
